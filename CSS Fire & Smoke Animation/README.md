# 🔥 CSS Fire & Smoke Animation

A **pure CSS fire & smoke animation** built with creative gradients, blurs, and keyframe animations.
This effect simulates realistic flames, glowing embers, and drifting smoke — all without JavaScript.

## 🛠️ How It Works

* **Flames** → Created with multiple layered `<div>` elements using radial/linear gradients.
* **Flicker Effect** → Achieved with CSS `@keyframes` animations that scale, move, and rotate.
* **Embers** → Small glowing particles animated with random delays.
* **Smoke** → Blurred, semi-transparent circles that rise upwards with varying opacity.

All done with **pure CSS animations** ✨

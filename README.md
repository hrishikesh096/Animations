# ⚡ Light Codes

A collection of **modern, open-source UI codes** — animations, effects, and components — crafted by **Team Light**.
From small CSS tricks ✨ to full-fledged UI concepts 🔥, everything lives here in one repo for you to **learn, remix, and build amazing projects**.

## 📂 Repository Structure

Every code/project lives inside its **own folder**, keeping things clean and modular.
Each folder includes:

* `index.html` → main file (always present ✅)
* `style.css` → optional stylesheet (if the code is bigger)
* `script.js` → optional JavaScript (if required)
* `README.md` → usage guide for that specific project

🔎 Example:

```
📁 Light Codes
 ┣ 📁 3D Flip Card

 ┃ ┗ README.md
 ┣ 📁 CSS Fire & Smoke Animation
 ┃ ┣ index.html
